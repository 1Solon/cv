# My CV

This is my CV, written in Latex, this is primarily intended to host both the files themselves, and also my toolchain to make the files.

## How I am making this

I am using a Latex Dev Container running in Docker and VsCode, the initial container was made by [qdm12](https://github.com/qdm12) the repo is [here](https://github.com/qdm12/latexdevcontainer)

This dev container is a real life saver, so if you can contribute to them. Please do. 

## How to use this

Open the folder in VsCode, and you will be prompted to open the folder in a dev container, click yes, and it will open a container. You should now be able to build the Latex files.
