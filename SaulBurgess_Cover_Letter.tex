\opening{To whom it may concern,}

I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer position at NTT DATA. As a
recent graduate with a Master’s Degree in Computer Science from Technological
University Dublin, I am eager to bring my passion for software development,
cloud computing, and data-driven solutions to your innovative and
forward-thinking team.

During my studies, I developed a strong foundation in Java, Python, and SQL,
with expertise in frameworks such as Spring and Struts. My Master's Thesis
involved developing a web application called Magpie, a Geographical Information
System designed for Local Authorities to assist in urban planning. Magpie was
built as a microservices-based application with robust backend and database
services, reinforcing my understanding of scalable system design, database
optimization, and API development.

Beyond academics, I actively expand my technical expertise through personal
projects. I maintain a Kubernetes-based home lab where I deploy and manage
services such as media archiving and single-sign-on authentication. This
hands-on experience has strengthened my proficiency in DevOps practices, CI/CD
pipelines, and cloud infrastructure management.

NTT DATA’s commitment to innovation, adaptability, and business transformation
resonates strongly with me. Your focus on delivering high-quality software
solutions, optimizing database performance, and streamlining processes for
efficiency aligns perfectly with my technical skills and career aspirations. I
am eager to contribute my expertise in Java, SQL, and scripting to help develop
and maintain scalable, high-performance applications that support business
goals.

I am highly motivated, adaptable, and committed to continuous learning. I look
forward to the opportunity to collaborate with experienced professionals at NTT
DATA while bringing fresh perspectives and problem-solving capabilities to the
team.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my CV and would
welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills align with NTT DATA’s
objectives. I am enthusiastic about the possibility of joining your team and
contributing to cutting-edge technology solutions.

\closing{Yours sincerely,}
